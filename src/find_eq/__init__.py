    Each bid represents a buyer's maximum willingness to pay for exactly one
    indivisible unit. Each ask represents a seller's minimum acceptable price
    for exactly one indivisible unit. The market clears at the maximum quantity
    where gains from trade are non-negative.

        quantity, or None if no trade is possible (i.e., all asks exceed
        all bids).
